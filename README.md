ngyn
=======

ngyn is a collection of modules and directives initially extracted from a large scale, entity-centric, configuration management application created by Configit Software.

These components typically help reduce some of the inevitable boilerplate code which creeps into larger applications.

Modules Currently include

* __Resourceful Routing__: Adds advanced rails style routing to AngularJS. Particularly useful in entity-centric apps.
* __Resource Extensions__: Hooks for adding data on the way out or parsing it on the way in.
* __Select Key__: Allows you to specify a way to match an ng-option element to the select's ng-model.
* __Select2__: A directive to perform an in-place progressive enhancement to convert a select element into a select2 one.
